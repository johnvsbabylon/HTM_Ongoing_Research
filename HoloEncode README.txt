Abstract
HoloEncode is a web-based computational artifact that renders the emergence of (d+1)-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime from a d-dimensional Conformal Field Theory (CFT) boundary. By implementing a visual interface for the Multi-scale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA), this tool demonstrates the mechanisms of the AdS/CFT correspondence, specifically visualizing the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for holographic entanglement entropy, HKLL bulk reconstruction via boundary operator smearing, and the geometric origins of fermion mass hierarchies (Koide formula) and mixing angles (PMNS braiding).
This repository contains the source code for "reverse engineering" the information structure of the vacuum.
1. Theoretical Framework: It From Qubit
The core premise of this simulation is the Holographic Principle: the postulate that the physics of a gravitational bulk volume is mathematically equivalent to a quantum field theory encoded on its lower-dimensional boundary.
1.1 The Tensor Network (MERA)
The application visualizes the bulk geometry not as a continuous manifold, but as a discrete Tensor Network. We utilize a simplified MERA structure, which represents a discrete realization of the Renormalization Group (RG) flow.
* Boundary (Layer 0): Represents the UV (Ultraviolet) microscopic degrees of freedom (qubits).
* Bulk (Layer N): Represents the IR (Infrared) coarse-grained geometry.
* The Radial Direction (z): In our simulation, the "depth" of the 3D funnel corresponds to the scale of entanglement renormalization.
The metric of the emergent spacetime is defined by the density of entanglement in this network.
1.2 Ryu-Takayanagi & Spacetime Connectivity
The simulation visually proves the Ryu-Takayanagi Formula, which relates the entanglement entropy S_A of a boundary region A to the area of a minimal surface \gamma_A (geodesic) in the bulk:
In the Simulation:
* The "Pink Line" represents \gamma_A. It actively solves for the geodesic path that minimizes distance through the hyperbolic bulk metric.
* Firewall Phenomenon: When the user severs boundary entanglement links (setting entanglement entropy S \to 0), the minimal surface collapses. This visually demonstrates Mark Van Raamsdonk's conjecture: Spacetime is generated by quantum entanglement. Without entanglement, the geometric connectivity of the bulk is destroyed, creating a "firewall" or topological defect.
2. Bulk Reconstruction: The HKLL Dictionary
How does a local particle in the bulk relate to the boundary? The simulation implements the Hamilton-Kabat-Lifschytz-Lowe (HKLL) reconstruction protocol.
A bulk scalar field \phi(z, x) can be represented as a "smeared" integral of boundary operators \mathcal{O}(x'):
In the Simulation:
* Hover Effect: When the user hovers over the bulk wireframe, a pink glow appears on the boundary strip.
* Green's Function Visualization:
   * Near Boundary (Small z): The boundary support is narrow (local).
   * Deep Bulk (Large z): The boundary support is wide (non-local).
* This visualizes causal wedge reconstruction, showing that "deep" information is protected by quantum error correcting codes spread across large regions of the boundary.
3. Fermionic Information Geometry
The artifact extends standard AdS/CFT to propose geometric origins for Standard Model parameters.
3.1 The Koide Formula & Mass Hierarchy
We test the hypothesis that lepton masses are eigenvalues of a geometric operator (a circulant matrix acting on flavor space). The simulation calculates the Koide Ratio Q in real-time:
Visualized Mechanics:
* The simulation renders the Electron (e), Muon (\mu), and Tau (\tau) as excitations at specific radial depths (z_{UV}, z_{Intermediate}, z_{IR}) within the tensor network.
* The "heaviness" of the Tau is visually correlated to its position deep in the IR (infrared) sector of the bulk, probing the vacuum expectation value (VEV) at a different scale than the electron.
3.2 Neutrino Braiding (PMNS Matrix)
The "Braiding" view demonstrates Topological Quantum Computation (TQC). We posit that neutrino oscillations arise from the braiding of fermion worldlines (Anyons) governed by the Braid Group B_3.
* Logic: The mixing angles \theta_{12}, \theta_{23}, \theta_{13} of the PMNS matrix are generated by specific braid words (generators \sigma_1, \sigma_2) applied to the topological strands.
* Result: The unitary evolution U_{PMNS} is treated as a quantum logic gate executing flavor mixing.
4. Technical Implementation
The artifact is built as a single-file React application using WebGL for high-performance rendering.
* Render Engine: Three.js (r160) for the AdS_3 bulk geometry and geodesic calculations.
* Physics Engine: Custom JavaScript logic for real-time entropy calculation, geodesic minimization (gradient descent approximation), and tensor network state propagation.
* UI/UX: Tailwind CSS with glassmorphism design, optimized for mobile (Samsung Galaxy A35) touch interfaces using mutual exclusion panel logic.
Running the Simulation
1. Open holo_encoder_final.html in any modern web browser.
2. Geometry Mode: Interact with the bulk. Click boundary bars to sever entanglement. Observe the "Firewall" formation.
3. Particle Mode: Observe the HKLL smearing and Mass Hierarchy depths.
4. Braiding Mode: Visualize the topological origin of neutrino mixing.
5. Conclusion
HoloEncode is not merely a visualization; it is a proposal. It argues that the universe is a quantum simulation where geometry, mass, and forces are emergent properties of an underlying information processing substrate. By reverse-engineering the holographic code, we move one step closer to accessing the "Source Code" of reality.
